		<h3 class="entry-title">Object Object Models</h3>
		
		<p>These are the object models for the objects within an <a href="objectlayermodel.html">Object Layer</a>. Objects may be accessed with indices, names, or iterators. The word "Object" is not meant in a generic sense and is used (when unmodified) to refer to objects created by Tiled within an Object Layer.</p>

		<ul>
			<h4 class="list-title">Object</h4>
			<li><code>object.props</code> : <a href="propstable.html">Properties Table</a></li>
			<li><code>object._objType</code> : String equal to the type of object it is.</li>
			<li><code>object._name</code> : Corresponds to the value set in Tiled's "Name" field within the object's properties dialog. This value can be used to access the object within the object's parent layer; each object is stored in the parent layer's <code>object</code> table as <code>layer[object._name]</code>.</li>
			<li><code>object._type</code> : Corresponds to the value set in Tiled's "Type" field within the object's properties dialog.</li>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<h4 class="list-title">Ellipse</h4>
				<li>An ellipse object is created with the ellipse drawing command within Tiled. They represent any oval shape.</li>
				<li>An ellipse object's <code>_objType</code> is <code>ellipse</code>.</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<h4 class="list-title">Polygons &amp; Polylines</h4>
				<li>Polygon and polyline objects are created with the polygon and polyline drawing commands within Tiled. They represent vertices connected with lines. The only difference betwixt the two is that a polygon object has one additional line reaching from the last vertex to the beginning vertex.</li>
				<li>A polygon object's <code>_objType</code> is <code>polygon</code>, and a polyline's <code>_objType</code> is <code>polyline</code>.</li>
				<li><code>object.points</code> : The vertices of the polygon or polyline. These are given in the form <code>points[i] = {x = x, y = y}</code> where <code>i</code> is the vertex index, <code>x</code> is the X-coordinate of the vertex, and <code>y</code> is the Y-coordinate of the vertex. The origin for these vertices is the polygon or polyline's first vertex.</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<h4 class="list-title">Image Objects</h4>
				<li>Image objects are created with the image stamp tool within Tiled. They are created as single tiles, yet they are more customizable than a Tile Layer's tiles. An important thing to note, however, is that image objects are not culled.</li>
				<li>An image object's <code>_objType</code> is <code>image</code>.</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<h4 class="list-title">Rectangle Objects</h4>
				<li>Rectangle objects are created with the rectangle drawing tool within Tiled. They represent a four-sided polygon with four right angles and two pairs of parallel sides.</li>
				<li>A rectangle object's <code>_objType</code> is, by default, dependent on its dimensions. To disable this behaviour, set the <code>objTypeRectPointSquare</code> preference to <code>false</code> (see <a href="setpreference.html">this guide</a> for more information).</li>
				<li>A rectangle whose dimensions are <code>(w, h) = (0, 0)</code> has by default an <code>_objType</code> of <code>point</code>, a rectangle with dimensions <code>w = h</code> has by default an <code>_objType</code> of <code>square</code>, and everything else has an <code>_objType</code> of <code>rectangle</code>. If the <code>objTypeRectPointSquare</code> setting is disabled, all rectangle objects have an <code>_objType</code> of <code>rectangle</code>.</li>
